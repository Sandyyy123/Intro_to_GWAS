# Intro_to_GWAS
An introductory workshop to GWAS analysis using PLINK and R

## Overview
In this workshop we will explore the basics of performing Genomewide Association Studies (GWAS) using a combination of the software `plink` (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) and `R` (http://www.r-project.org/).

At a later stage (a separate workshop) we will also introduce the `GenABEL` package which offers additional functionality of genomic association analyses in R.

This workshop is written to be accessible to a range of people, from those that have never performed any command-line work, to those that just want a refresher. As such I have written it to include clear and straight forward outlines of all `R` and `plink` operations, most of the time stepping through these one line at at time.
